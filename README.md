I used Masonry layout for the interactive photo gallery because of its ability to organize photos of varying sizes dynamically, creating a visually appealing, responsive, and space-efficient design. It enhances user experience with its artistic arrangement, seamless adaptability to different screens, and compatibility with interactive features like hover effects and lightbox pop-ups. These websites are using this layout : Pinterest, Unsplash, Behance, Dribbble, Tumblr and E-commerce Stores.
