This project features an interactive online photo gallery inspired by the dynamic layouts of popular platforms like Pinterest, Unsplash, Behance, and Dribbble. The gallery uses a Masonry layout, chosen for its ability to elegantly organize photos of varying sizes, creating a visually appealing, responsive, and space-efficient design. This layout enhances the user experience through its artistic arrangement, adaptability across different devices, and seamless integration with interactive features like hover effects and lightbox pop-ups.

Future enhancements include the integration of a database, enabling user sign-ups for personalized experiences and additional functionality.
